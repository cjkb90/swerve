# swerve
Swerve is a computer vision based traffic collision mapping and visualization tool.

The purpose of Swerve is to help insurance companies view footage of traffic accidents. Swerve will quickly identify collisions
within public footage of roads and highways and analyze the motions of the vehicles involved. This reduces the amount of time agents
and police officers spend finding video and allows them to process claims more efficiently.

Swerve's UI was built on JavaScript, and the data analysis was done using Python. Mapping services are provided by Verizon ThingsSpace's
"Mapquest" API, while vehicle data was compiled with ThingSpace's Device Messaging API.
